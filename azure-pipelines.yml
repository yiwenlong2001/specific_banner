# Azure Pipelines configuration that builds and packages the extension.
# To learn more about Azure Pipelines: https://aka.ms/learn-azure-pipelines

# This pipeline creates both the prod and ppe vsix extension files.
# These files are then uploaded to ado pipeline artifacts.
# When a PR to master is made, a build is kicked off. On success it is deployed to ppe for testing.
# When the PR is approved and the code is merged to master approval is required for deployment to prod. 
# ppe will publish the PPE vsix and prod will publish the prod vsix to the visual studio marketplace.
